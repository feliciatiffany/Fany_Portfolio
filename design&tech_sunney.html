                            <h2>Overview</h2>
                            <p>Sunney is an interactive game developed with p5.js (JavaScript Library) that reflects the journey of discovering and pursuing passions. Inspired by the metaphor that life is like a game, players take on the role of Sunney, a sunflower character that navigates through different challenges, representing personal growth and self-discovery. The game unfolds through a series of stages, each symbolizing a different passion—music, art, and technology—capturing the evolution of interests over time. As players progress, the world transitions from a grayscale that represents uncertainty to the colorful conclusion that signifies growth and self-awareness. By gamifying this process, Sunney emphasizes that discovering passions is not always linear but an exciting adventure shaped by curiosity and perseverance.
                                Designed as an autobiographical yet universally relatable experience, Sunney encourages players to explore, adapt, and embrace their individual paths. The game integrates storytelling, interactive gameplay, and visual aesthetics to create an engaging narrative that mirrors real-life challenges and aspirations.

                            <h2>Development Process</h2>
                            <h3>1. Programming & Interaction Design</h3>
                            <p>The foundation of the project was established through Arduino programming, which controlled the bear’s movements and responses to user input. The system utilized a servo motor to manage the bear’s positioning while integrating an ultrasonic distance sensor to detect hand proximity. The interactive sequence was designed to create a playful engagement where the bear dynamically reacted to audience interaction.
                                A structured function-based approach ensured smooth operation, with specific conditions determining when the bear would emerge or retreat. Timed intervals introduced an autonomous movement pattern, creating a continuous engagement cycle that encouraged further interaction.
                                
                            </p>
                            
                            <h3>2. Physical Construction & Mechanical Integration</h3>
                            <p> The enclosure was constructed using wood built at the Woodlab, providing a sturdy framework to house the electronic components. The internal mechanism featured a precisely designed seesaw system. The servo motor was strategically positioned to achieve consistent movement, ensuring responsive and natural interactions.
                                The assembly process involved precision cutting and alignment of structural components. Hinges and fastening elements were incorporated to allow for accessibility while maintaining durability. The final build successfully combined aesthetics with functionality, creating an engaging physical interface.
                                
                            </p>
                            
                            <h3>3. Visual & Text-Based Interaction</h3>
                            <p> To enhance user engagement, a Processing-based digital interface was developed to complement the physical installation. This interface displayed dynamic text interactions that responded to the bear’s movement. Serial communication between Arduino and Processing enabled real-time feedback, allowing the bear to display playful messages corresponding to user actions.
                                The interface design focused on clarity and accessibility, ensuring that the textual elements complemented the physical gameplay. The result was an integrated system where both digital and physical components worked cohesively to provide an immersive experience.
